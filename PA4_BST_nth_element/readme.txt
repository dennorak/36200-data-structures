NOTE: The tree is auto-balanced inherently by taking the median value
        of the data, and passing the left and right halves of the 
        existing data to the left and right child nodes respectively.

c++ constants:
elements : the array passed to the user

c++ inputs:
n : the n for n-th smallest element. Asked for after printing/building
        the tree and it's elements

to use:
- make
- make run
- when asked for n, give value from 1-15 (position in array)

to clean:
- make clean
